## Current Coverage vs. Targets

### ✅ Met Targets
- **Model**: 100.0% (Target: >80%) - EXCEEDS ✅
- **Config**: 83.5% (Target: >80%) - MEETS ✅
- **MCP Server**: 83.7% (Target: >80%) - EXCEEDS ✅ (Improved from 70.2%)

### ⚠️ Close to Target
- **Handler**: 84.8% (Target: >85%) - Need 0.2% more
  - Gaps: UpdateLocation (67.6%), GetLocationTime (77.3%)

- **Repository**: 77.3% (Target: >80%) - Need 2.7% more
  - Gaps: Update (70.8%), Delete (70.0%), isSQLiteConstraintError (66.7%)

## Coverage Breakdown

### Repository (77.3% - Need 80%+)
**Well Covered**:
- Create: 86.4% ✅
- GetByName: 81.2% ✅
- List: 78.6% ⚠️

**Needs Improvement**:
- Update: 70.8% ❌
- Delete: 70.0% ❌
- isSQLiteConstraintError: 66.7% ❌

**Missing Test Cases**:
- Update: Error paths when rowsAffected fails
- Delete: Error paths when rowsAffected fails
- isSQLiteConstraintError: Test nil error case

### Handler (84.8% - Need 85%+)
**Well Covered**:
- CreateLocation: High coverage ✅
- ListLocations: High coverage ✅
- GetLocation: 86.7% ✅
- DeleteLocation: 85.7% ✅

**Needs Improvement**:
- UpdateLocation: 67.6% ❌ (biggest gap)
- GetLocationTime: 77.3% ⚠️

**Missing Test Cases**:
- UpdateLocation: More error scenarios
- GetLocationTime: Time formatting edge cases

### MCP Server (83.7% - Exceeds 80%+ Target) ✅
**Well Covered**:
- wrapWithMetrics: 100.0% ✅ (Improved from 0.0%)
- handleGetCurrentTime: 100.0% ✅
- handleAddTimeOffset: 100.0% ✅
- handleAddLocation: 92.3% ✅
- handleRemoveLocation: 88.2% ✅
- handleListLocations: 85.7% ✅
- handleGetLocationTime: 80.0% ✅

**Needs Improvement**:
- handleUpdateLocation: 74.3% ⚠️
- NewServer: 70.8% ⚠️
- NewServerWithMetrics: 70.8% ⚠️ (Improved from 0.0%)

**Impact**: Adding tests for NewServerWithMetrics and wrapWithMetrics increased package coverage from 70.2% → 83.7%, exceeding the 80% target.

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Improve Repository Coverage (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
Add edge case tests for:
1. Update/Delete error handling
2. isSQLiteConstraintError edge cases

**Impact**: Would increase Repository from 77.3% → ~82% (meet 80% target)

### Priority 2: Improve Handler Coverage
Add error scenario tests for:
1. UpdateLocation edge cases
2. GetLocationTime formatting errors

**Impact**: Would increase Handler from 84.8% → ~87% (exceed 85% target)
