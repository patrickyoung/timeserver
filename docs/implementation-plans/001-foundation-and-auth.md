## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Configuration Guardrails**: Fail-fast validation prevented production misconfigurations
2. **Dual MCP Transport**: Supporting both stdio and HTTP enables multiple use cases
3. **Provider-Agnostic Auth**: Works with any OIDC provider without code changes
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: ADRs and guides make decisions explicit
5. **Security by Default**: Hardening built-in from the start, not bolted on later

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Testing Coverage**: Some packages could use higher coverage (auth at 59.6%)
2. **Integration Tests**: More end-to-end tests would increase confidence
3. **Performance Testing**: Load testing not performed
4. **Database Support**: Originally no persistence (addressed in Plan 002)

### Reusability

This implementation serves as a **blueprint** for future Go services:

1. Copy project structure and Makefile
2. Adapt configuration for new service requirements
3. Reuse middleware patterns
4. Reuse container hardening approach
5. Reuse CI/CD pipeline structure
6. Reuse documentation templates
